"""
This is a simpler template for script for SD.Next that implements a custom pipeline
Items that can be added:
- Any pipeline already in diffusers
  List of pipelines that can be directly used: <https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/pipelines>
- Any pipeline for which diffusers definiotion exists and can be copied
  List of pipelines with community definitions: <https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community>
- Any custom pipeline that you create

Author::
- Your details

Credits:
- Link to original implementation and author

Contributions:
- Submit a PR on SD.Next GitHub repo to be included in /scripts
- Before submitting a PR, make sure to test your script thoroughly and that it passes code quality checks
  Lint rules are part of SD.Next CI/CD pipeline

# if pipeline requires a param and its not provided, it will result in runtime error
# if you provide param that is not defined by pipeline, sdnext will strip it
